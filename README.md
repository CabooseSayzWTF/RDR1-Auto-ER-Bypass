This is the plugin source code to my auto er bypass.<br>
<br>
You must have a hen/cfw enabled ps3 and the ps3 sdk to modify/rebuild the plugin.<br>
You must have a rgh/jtag xbox 360 and the xbox 360 sdk to modify/rebuild the plugin.<br>
<br>
<br>
The ps3 sprx has only been signed and tested with hen, I can not guarantee that it will work with cfw however the source is there so I don't see why you can't compile
the plugin and sign it for cfw as is.<br>
<br>
For ps3 it will only work with blus and bles goty.<br>
For xbox 360 it will only work for Media ID-5B48AF70 Undead Nightmare.<br>
<br>
I no longer have a use for this so that is why I am releasing it, instead of deleting it figured maybe somebody might have a use for it.<br>
<br>
As is this source code will not be updated or maintained by me, it comes "as is" and you are responsible for what you use it for.<br>
